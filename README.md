# Debitech

This is a DebiTech payment library extracted from production code.

You can use this to do subscription payments without needing to handle any
credit card information yourself.

Todo:

* Examples and documentation
* Gotchas about the debitech API
* Page set templates (the pages that are shown at DIBS to input credit card info)
* Rake tasks to update page sets

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'debitech'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install debitech

## Usage: Preparation

Get the API docs in DIBS manager, setup the account.

    TODO: Someone could send a pull request with more docs here on how to setup a new
          account, what to consider and what you should ask the support for.

## Usage: Adding a credit card

    # MAC:    Secret key shared by your app and DIBS, get it from the DIBS manager 
    # METHOD: Something like cc.cekab, check the docs or ask support.
    debitech_web_config = {
      :merchant => "ACCOUNT_NAME",
      :secret_key => "MAC",
      :fields => { :method => "METHOD" }
    }

    # In the view: form to redirect the user to DIBS
    <% api = Debitech::WebApi.new(debitech_web_config) %>
    <form accept-charset="iso-8859-1" action="<%= api.form_action %>" method="post">
      <% api.form_fields.each do |name, value| %>
        <input name="<%= name %>" type="hidden" value="<%= value %>">
      <% end %>

      <!-- send translation strings, redirect back urls, etc here -->
      <input name="redirect_back_url" type="hidden" value="http://yourapp/credit_cards">
    </form>

    # When you get the response back (TODO: add example templates)
    api.valid_response?(mac, sum, reply, verify_id) # is the response from DIBS?
    api.approved_reply?(reply)                      # was the card added successfully?

    # Store verify_id as your reference to the card.

## Usage: Charging a credit card

Configuration:

    # METHOD, MAC, ACCOUNT_NAME: Just like with the Web Api. 
    # API_USER, API_PASSWORD:    A API user you can create in DIBS manager.
    debitech_server_config = {
      :method => "METHOD",
      :secret_key => "MAC",
      :soap_opts => {
        :merchant => "ACCOUNT_NAME",
        :username => "API_USER",
        :password => "API_PASSWORD"
      }
    }

First try to get "valid_credentials?" to return true using [debitech_soap](https://github.com/joakimk/debitech_soap). If it does not work, try to regenerate the password for the API user. Some characters are not possible with the SOAP library.

Charging a credit card:

    debitech = Debitech::ServerApi.new(debitech_server_config)

    # VERIFY_ID:        The id you get back when registering a card.
    # AMOUNT:           The amount to charge, must be in cents (1 SEK = 100).
    # IP:               The ip, can be "127.0.0.1", but the request ip is probably more useful.
    # UNIQUE_REFERENCE: A unique reference, you want this to be something like invoice-NUM,
    #                   so that you can search for it in DIBS manager with "invoice*". This
    #                   is required so that you don't charge more than once for a single
    #                   payment by accident. Must be atleast 5 characters long.
    debitech.charge(:verify_id => verify_id,
                    :amount => AMOUNT,
                    :unique_reference => "UNIQUE_REFERENCE",
                    :currency => "SEK",
                    :ip => "IP")

This returns a Debitech::ServerApi::ChargeResult, check [server_api.rb](https://github.com/barsoom/debitech/blob/master/lib/debitech/server_api.rb).

In case it's "pending?", you can try again later with the same unique reference. The error is probably due to temporary timeout or error between DIBS and the bank systems.
