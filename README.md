# Debitech

This is a DebiTech payment library extracted from production code.

You can use this to do subscription payments without needing to handle any
credit card information yourself.

Todo:

* Examples and documentation
* Gotchas about the debitech API
* Page set templates (the pages that are shown at DIBS to input credit card info)
* Rake tasks to update page sets

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'debitech'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install debitech

## Usage: Preparation

Get the API docs in DIBS manager, setup the account.

    TODO: Someone could send a pull request with more docs here on
    how to setup a new account, what to consider and what you should
    ask the support for.

## Usage: Adding a credit card

    # MAC: Secret key shared by your app and DIBS, get it from the DIBS manager 
    # METHOD: Something like cc.cekab, check the docs or ask support.
    debitech_web_config = {
      :merchant => "ACCOUNT_NAME",
      :secret_key => "MAC",
      :fields => { :method => "METHOD" }
    }

    # In the view: form to redirect the user to DIBS
    <% api = Debitech::WebApi.new(debitech_web_config) %>
    <form accept-charset="iso-8859-1" action="<%= api.form_action %>" method="post">
      <% api.form_fields.each do |name, value| %>
        <input name="<%= name %>" type="hidden" value="<%= value %>">
      <% end %>

      <!-- send translation strings, redirect back urls, etc here -->
      <input name="redirect_back_url" type="hidden" value="http://yourapp/credit_cards">
    </form>

    # When you get the response back (TODO: add example templates)
    api.valid_response?(mac, sum, reply, verify_id) # is the response from DIBS?
    api.approved_reply?(reply)                      # was the card added successfully?

    # Store verify_id as your reference to the card.

## Usage: Charging a credit card
